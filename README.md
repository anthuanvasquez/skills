# Skills

Repository to hold standardized guidance, agent rules, and scaffold templates for applying AI agents (Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and PI) safely and productively in engineering workflows.

## Quick Start

Install globally with platform wiring prompts:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthuanvasquez/skills/main/install.sh | bash
```

Install non-interactive:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthuanvasquez/skills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --platforms gemini,copilot --non-interactive
```

Supported platform values (for both `--platforms` and the interactive prompt):

- `none`
- `gemini`
- `copilot`
- `pi`
- `all`
- Comma-separated combinations like `gemini,copilot`

Default behavior installs `skills/` into `~/.agents/skills` and only wires selected platforms.

## Dev Container Feature

This repository ships a Dev Container Feature consumable from GHCR.

The feature is designed to keep this repository as the source of truth:

- Uses packaged feature files when available.
- Uses local repository source during local development.
- Falls back to cloning this repository when needed.

Feature option:

- `platforms` (string): `none|gemini|copilot|pi|all|csv`

Example:

```json
{
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/anthuanvasquez/skills/skills:latest": {
			"platforms": "none"
		}
	}
}
```

An example consumer exists at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
